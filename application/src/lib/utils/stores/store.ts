/**
 * A note on what this file does:
 *
 * This file defines "stores." Stores are Svelte's method of "state" management. Essentially, state is data that
 * needs to be accessed throughout the application. Typically, we can pass data to the different Svelte components via
 * props, however, sometimes this isn't feasible. For instance, every component might need to access a payers profile
 * information. Instead of having to pass that info between each of the components, we can create a store. These stores
 * are accessible throughout the application.
 *
 * So, in this file, we will define a few different stores for state we want to manage.
 *
 * By default, this does not persist. As in, once the browser is reloaded, the data is reset. So, we will need to make
 * calls to the API again to save data back into the stores, OR we can create special stores that will persist using
 * cookies, which is probably something we will do in the future.
